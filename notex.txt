this was quite a tricky one, first i struggled with making this even function, then i looked it up and now I understand how this should 
function, this was pretty valueable imo because I think i can use this kind of concept to help me with another project I'm working on 
right now where I'm stuck
The thing here that could help me imo is that this program has a constatntly refreshing(rerunning) code, if you look closer the "saveAndRenderBooks"
function appears a lot in the code, and it makes this code rerun a lot. This combined with the localstorage might help me out

New Things: 
  FormData: I didn't knew about this thing before, basicly it etracts the values from a form in a key=value format (the keys are the name
  tags of the input elements)

  LocalStorage: This is knew to me too. And I still don't quite understand it. I think its is a big JSON file holding all the previos data??

  setAttribute: I knew about setting attributes but this was a new waz for me

Problems: 
  Changing color: In the function "createReadElement" the element should change its color, at first i had a lot of problem with this because 
  I didn't realise one simple thing and i focused on the event listener part of the function while all i had to do was add "solution"
